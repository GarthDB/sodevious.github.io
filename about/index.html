        <article>
            <p class="featured-paragraph">
                Hola &mdash; I'm Nicole and I'm a senior product designer &amp; front end developer
                at <a href="http://sawhorsemedia.com">Sawhorse Media</a>. I'm a completely self taught
                designer, and have been madly in love with markup for the past seven years.
                Based out of Brooklyn, NY, some of my favorite things are getting lost on my bike and
                discovering new foods (and 'hoods).
